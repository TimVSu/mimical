## EmotionAl | Emotions and facial expressions in everyday life | (EmotionAl for short)

* Aim: Development of an everyday self-exercise program for people with facial paresis (facial paralysis), which affected persons can use as additional training parallel to regular speech therapy.

## Motivation

* In Germany annually "200,000 first-time (...) and approx. 70,000 repeated strokes "1 How many of them also suffer from facial paresis is not recorded [see Swiss Neuropaediatric Stroke Registery (2000-2009): almost 60% had some form of facial paresis].
* in many places there is no sufficient offer of speech therapy treatment available
* self-training is an important part of the recovery process
* outpatient speech therapy is not sufficient for intensive therapy
