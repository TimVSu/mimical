# Team-08 – EmotionAl Readme File
## EmotionAl | Emotions and facial expressions in everyday life | (EmotionAl for short)

* Aim: Development of an everyday self-exercise program for people with facial paresis (facial paralysis), which affected persons can use as additional training parallel to regular speech therapy.

## Motivation

* In Germany annually "200,000 first-time (...) and approx. 70,000 repeated strokes "1 How many of them also suffer from facial paresis is not recorded [see Swiss Neuropaediatric Stroke Registry (2000-2009): almost 60% had some form of facial paresis].
* in many places there is no sufficient offer of speech therapy treatment available
* self-training is an important part of the recovery process
* outpatient speech therapy is not sufficient for intensive therapy

## Report
* Our team held daily meetings throughout the entire sprint to ensure that everyone was on the same page. Additionally, we held weekly remote meetings with our partners (from Gateway/Humanwissenschaftliche Fakultät) to exchange ideas/discuss our results and an in-person meeting at the beginning of the sprint.
